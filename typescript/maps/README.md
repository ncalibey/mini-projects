# maps

This is a simple applications that serves as an introduction to TypeScript. It is a part of
Stephen Grider's [TypeScript Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/).

All the application does is create a google map (your google API key must be inserted into
`index.html`) and then generate two random markers, one which represents a user, and another which
represents a company. You can use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to easily refresh the app during
development.
