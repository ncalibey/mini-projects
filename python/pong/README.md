pong
===

This is a pong clone based from Christian Thompson's tutorial (source code [here](http://christianthompson.com/sites/default/files/Pong/pong.py)) which was originally found thorugh freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. This isn't the most optimized nor idiomatic design, but I did it just to get a better grasp on Python's syntax via a fun project (as opposed to algorithm challenges).
