# grpc-blog

This application is an example of how to create a blog using gRPC (implemented in Go). Clients can
perform CRUD operations on blogs via the `blog_client/client.go` file. The data is stored in
MongoDB.

This is the final project of St√©phane Maarek's [gRPC Udemy Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/grpc-golang/) which I highly recommend.
