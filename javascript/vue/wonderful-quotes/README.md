wonderful quotes
===
This is a small VueJS application that allows a user to add up to 10 quotes that they like. Clicking on a note will remove it. This app was largely built to practice using slots and emitting events. It's part of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's _[Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)_ Udemy course.
