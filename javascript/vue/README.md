Monster Slayer is game built with VueJS as part of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's _[Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)_ Udemy course (highly recommended).

The game mimics RPG style games where you fight against a monster. You can either attack, use a special attack, heal, or give up. The purpose of the project was to show how easy it is to use Vue to create applications which in vanilla JS would be rather difficult.

To play, just clone the repo and then open the HTML file in a browser.
