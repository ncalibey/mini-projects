Flutter Projects
===

This repo contains various small Flutter projects I've worked on. Each of the projects only contains the contents of the `lib` as well as any other external necessities for running the app. 

To actually run any of these projects, create a new Flutter Project and move the contents into the root directory. After this just get the dependencies and then build for Android or iOS.
