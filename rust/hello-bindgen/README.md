hello-bindgen
===

hello-bindgen is the last WASM project from chapter 5 of Fullstack Rust, and serves as an example of using the wasm-bindgen crate for doing WASM as opposed to having to write all the glue code.

All the code does is log "Hello, Rust!" to the console. To see this, go into the `hello-bindgen-app` directory, run `npm install` and then `npm start`. After that, just go to `localhost:8080` and examine the console.
